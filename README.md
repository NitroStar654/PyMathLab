## Overview

PyMathLab provides a comprehensive set of tools to solve complex mathematical problems on compatible Python calculators. The project includes functions for solving equations, working with canonical forms, performing trigonometric calculations, and more.
This project is perfect for students, educators, and anyone interested in exploring mathematical utilities and learning how to implement them using Python.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your calculator or machine. Follow your calculator's instructions for setting up a Python environment, or install Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/NitroStar654/PyMathLab.git
cd PyMathLab
```

## Usage

### Running the scripts

The PyMathLab project is contained in a single file called ```PLM.py```, designed for Python-enabled calculators like the TI-83 Python Edition. To run it:

1. Transfer the ```PLM.py``` file to your calculator using software such as TI Connect CE.

2. Once the file is transferred, open the Python interpreter on your calculator.

3. Run the script by typing ```from PLM import *```  or ```run('PLM.py')```, depending on your calculator's interface.

### Using the tools

The script offers several mathematical tools accessible through a menu. Here's an overview of the available features:

- Main Menu:
  - [1] Basic Math
    - Factorial
    - Square Root
  - [2] Advanced Math
    - Solve Quadratic Equations (Canonical form)
  - [3] Exit

#### Example of Usage

To calculate the factorial of a number, choose option ```[1] Basic Math``` and then ```[1] Factorial```.
To solve a quadratic equation, select ```[2] Advanced Math```, then input the coefficients for the equation.
After transferring the script, simply navigate through the menus to perform various mathematical operations.
